- Once Apache and MySQL are running, create a database called db_library and create the required tables necessary using phpmyadmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

- Create a folder called "library" in the htdocs folder wherever you placed the xampp directory on your computer

- Download the files from this repo: https://github.com/vvyn/volcanic-chocolate-library

- Place all the files from the project folder here on the GitHub into the library folder created before

- Then on your browser navigate to http://localhost/library/index.html to find the homepage

- Access the website and execute CRUD functions on the 4 entities (Book, Librarian, Loan, Library Card User)
