Once Apache and MySQL are running, create a database called db_library and create the required tables necessary using phpmyadmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/.
Configure XXAMP with the link of the deployed website at this link: https://vvyn.github.io/volcanic-chocolate-library
Create a folder called "library" in the htdocs folder wherever you placed the xampp directory on your computer.
Place all the files from the project folder here on the GitHub into the library folder created above.
Then on your browser navigate to http://localhost/library/index.html to find the homepage.
Access the website and execute CRUD functions on the 4 entities (Book, Librarian, Loan, Library Card User)
